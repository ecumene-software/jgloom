JOOGL (Java Object-oriented OpenGL) is Java library that wraps the functionality of the OpenGL API in a more 
object-oriented package. It wraps OpenGL objects and functions into Java interfaces, creating a platform for
users to create their own 3D model and scene loaders. 
 
Currently it is in open-development and once the initial model is finished there will be a maven repository.
