JGLOOM Java openGL: Object Oriented (man!) is Java library that wraps the functionality of the OpenGL API in a more
object-oriented package. It puts OpenGL objects into Java interfaces, and their functions into static factories /
container utils, allowing for code to be reactive to the user's OpenGL version/platform dependency.

Currently it is in open-development and once the initial model is finished there will be a maven repository.
