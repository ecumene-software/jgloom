JGLOOm Java openGL: Object Oriented (man!) is Java library that wraps the functionality of the OpenGL API in a more
object-oriented package. It puts OpenGL objects into Java interfaces, and their functions into static factories /
container utils, allowing for code to be reactive to the user's OpenGL version/platform dependency.

This repository adds functionality to the [main jgloom project](https://github.com/team-jgloom/jgloom).

Currently it is in open-development and once the initial model is finished there will be a maven repository. 
Here's some file formats we intend to support: 
Image formats 
------------- 
- [ ] JPEG 
- [ ] PNG 
- [ ] TIFF 
- [ ] GIF 
- [ ] BMP 

Model formats 
------------- 
- [ ] MD5 - Animations and all
- [ ] OBJ 
- [ ] FBX 
- [ ] Collada - We intend to use [JCollada](http://javacollada.sourceforge.net/)
- [ ] Blend - In the very far future, as a tech demo (it would be very hard)
